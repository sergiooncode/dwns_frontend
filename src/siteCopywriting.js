export const HOME_MAIN_PARAGRAPH_1 = "Hi I'm Sergio and I'm trying to run an " +
"experiment here. I want to collect some vocal opinions based on " +
"experiences from car rental users. Below you can access a form I created with a " +
"few open-ended questions which I think will provide valid data points. " +
"I also leave the door open to add important questions that I might have missed."

export const HOME_MAIN_PARAGRAPH_2 = "My initial idea is to run the experiment " +
"in two phases, " +
"I'll drive traffic from Europe first and later from worldwide. " +
"The validity of the results will depend " +
"on the amount and quality of the data collected but " +
"ultimately it'd be kind cool to have like a small pulse of the " +
"car rental industry from the point of view of the users. " +
"That pulse will materialize in the presentation of the data collected whose " +
"development I'll start as soon as I have some meaningful data."

export const HOME_MAIN_PARAGRAPH_3 = "Since I've been able to drive a car " +
"I've made use of car rental companies " +
"many times and mainly in Spain and US."

export const HOME_MAIN_PARAGRAPH_4 = "Before 2018 I had rented from " +
"companies like Sixt or Pepecar in " +
"my home country, Spain. Every rental " +
"went generally without incident. In my opinion the companies " +
"acted as I expected them to, no surprises. I don't remember them " +
"being especially pushy trying to sell insurance and whatnot, or" +
"making use of abusive selling tactics like empty-to-empty gas tank policy" +
"or similar. " +
"I always tried to take care of the car like if it were " +
"mine. If accidentally I caused a " +
"scratch or similar to the car it was " +
"covered if I bought insurance and the " +
"franchise was enough. If " +
"I didn't buy insurance I had to pay from my own " +
"pocket. Someone could make the " +
"case that companies jump " +
"the price of the repair estimates but " +
"in any case if you break it " +
"you have to pay for it. That to me seems kind of fair."

export const HOME_MAIN_PARAGRAPH_5 = "In 2018 I moved back to Spain " +
"after having lived in the US for a few years and I was in for a big " +
"surprise from what I previously experienced. " +
"Unfortunately I was dragged into low cost car rental " +
"companies like Interrent and Goldcar-Rhodium. " +
"In the span of a few months I had two very " +
"unpleasant experiences which led me to dig " +
"deeper into what consumers out there were experiencing " +
"and what they had to say about car rental companies."

export const HOME_MAIN_PARAGRAPH_6 = "After some internet research, " +
"my first impression from reviews and opinions online " +
"mostly from car rental users in Spain was that there " +
"were at least two kinds of car " +
"rental companies: low cost companies and the rest " +
"of companies."
